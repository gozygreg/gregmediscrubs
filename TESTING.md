        - Python - PEP 8
            I used pycodestyle, a command-line tool installed with pip, to check my Python code since pep8online.com was still offline. I ran the command "pycodestyle --first <-appname->", as suggested in the documentation, to check all files in the app's directories and subdirectories and return the first error found. Through this process and cross-checking in the terminal of VScode, I found that the only errors were lines that exceeded the maximum line length limit (E501). Most of these errors were in the migrations directory of each app. However, since it is outside the scope of this project to modify the migrations files generated by the "python manage.py makemigrations" command, these errors were not addressed.







- ### Automated Tests
    Because of the time constraints, I prioritized completing the project over writing automated tests. As a result, I have made the decision to create manual tests for all the apps and features by testing each user story one by one.
