        - Python - PEP 8 <br>
            I used pycodestyle, a command-line tool installed with pip, to check my Python code since pep8online.com was still offline. I ran the command "pycodestyle --first <-appname->", as suggested in the documentation, to check all files in the app's directories and subdirectories and return the first error found. Through this process and cross-checking in the terminal of VScode, I found that the only errors were lines that exceeded the maximum line length limit (E501). Most of these errors were in the migrations directory of each app. However, since it is outside the scope of this project to modify the migrations files generated by the "python manage.py makemigrations" command, these errors were not addressed.

    - ### Lighthouse Score Review
        As seen above, the area where improvement is most needed is site accesibility. On running my first light house score, I noted that I needed to add label to buttons and forms in my html to make the site assessible for users of assistive technology such as screen readers.
        I then focused on product page, product detail page, checkout page, bag page, inquiry page, product management page, testimonial list page and testimonial detail page. I improved then to get an assesibility score of atleast 90
